#### Appendix

Hour contributions:

Each week (mostly Wednesdays at 1pm), we would meet for around 1-1.5 hours. This meetings would be for us to catch up 
on the work we had completed individually, figure out our next steps, and ask each other questions. The other working 
hours of the week were completed individually for assignments, research, and brainstorming.
