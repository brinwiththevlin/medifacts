The biggest constraint our group has to keep in mind is legality. It seems that everyday, there is some sort of data leak 
that occurs with varying ramifications for both the user and the company. Since we are dealing with users’ medical information, 
it is crucial that we handle this legally and securely. On top of the largest concern, medical information, we will be storing 
basic contact information as well as verification of said medical condition. If leaked, our users locations could possibly be 
determined, also posing a physical security threat. We are hoping to create a platform where people struggling with their 
medical issues feel safe to engage in conversation about questions and worries they’re going through. We are very aware that 
any leak or breach could be the end of our product, as people rightfully don’t want their medical information and feelings 
available for others to view. On the doctor’s side, we will be storing data that validates their professional background 
(such as degree and location of employment), which can turn into a physical security threat just as the user’s can.  

Another factor our team is taking into account is the ethics behind our platform. This project stemmed from the way doctors 
will caution patients to stay away from google as it can be fear mongering and full of falsehoods. There’s the common joke 
that if you google why you have a headache, the search results will tell you that you have just weeks left to live from a 
brain tumor. This will be a safe place for patients to ask and receive answers to those questions that may be traumatizing 
to google. With that in mind, we are planning to incorporate a method to block words (similar to on Twitter where it won’t 
show you any tweets that contain one of your blocked words). For example, a cancer patient may want to block the word “relapse”
if they’d like to avoid any mention of that. Additionally, there will be a result sorting method available, so patients can 
see the most relevant information to their case. For example, a patient receiving a CAR-T cell infusion would want to sort 
by the newest results, since such a new breakthrough in medicine will be evolving rapidly. The last privacy/safety feature 
will be one where users can make their question or post “private,” so only they and the doctors are able to view and interact 
with it. These features, while they create some extra work, are ones we feel ethically responsible to add as they are necessary
to make patients feel comfortable using our platform.
