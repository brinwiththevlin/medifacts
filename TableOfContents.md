# Medifacts 
## Laura Rodriguez, Sabrina Bauman, Nico Aleman, Grace Owens, Bryan Cora
Abstract:

We are seeking to create a platform to be the intersection between doctors and patients. Many times after a diagnosis, the patient is strongly advised to keep from researching their condition on their own. The reason for this is the internet being plagued with misinformation, horror stories, and medical jargon that the layperson can easily misinterpret. Medifacts strives to create a safe space for patients to ask questions and research, all while being counseled by a certified medical professional. Additionally, patients will be able to network with other patients of the same condition, allowing space for comradery and empathy.
