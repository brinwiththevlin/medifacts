**Total Hours: 50**

### Justification:
Throughout this project, I was involved in a range of tasks that contributed to the project's forward momentum. I attended team meetings, which involved productive collaboration and helped ensure we were on the same page each week. I took the time to familiarize myself with Angular and set up my development environment once the semester got going. I played a role in building out a test plan that included unit tests for our final product. Furthermore, I conducted research on existing platforms similar to our concept, identifying what would set us apart from our competitors in order to effectively market our idea. Additionally, I helped build out the front-end structure of our website, spending a good deal of time troubleshooting issues related to linking it to the API. I was also largely responsible for creating our Spring presentation, and helped build out the HTML for a reworked demo that was presented at the CEAS expo. Finally, I reorganized our project repository at the end of the term to meet the final report requirements. Overall, I worked on a diverse range of tasks that kept me busy throughout the semester and contributed to the end result of our project.

**Total Hours: 50**

### Justification:
I ended up doing quite a bit of things all over the spectrum of the project. On some of the smaller assignments throughout the beginning of the semester, such as the test plan and user manual, I contributed a lot. Additionally, I designed our entire expo poster, including everything that was written on it. On the programming side, I created the base project we worked with as well as the Firebase database we went with at first. This took a lot of research because I had worked with web apps before, but they always had a database already integrated in them. Then, I also did a bare bones login/register page in HTML just for a mock-up to have.
