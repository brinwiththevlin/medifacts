### Justification:
I ended up doing quite a bit of things all over the spectrum of the project. On some of the smaller assignments throughout the beginning of the semester, such as the test plan and user manual, I contributed a lot. Additionally, I designed our entire expo poster, including everything that was written on it. On the programming side, I created the base project we worked with as well as the Firebase database we went with at first. This took a lot of research because I had worked with web apps before, but they always had a database already integrated in them. Then, I also did a bare bones login/register page in HTML just for a mock-up to have.
