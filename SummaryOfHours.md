**Total Hours: 50**

### Justification:
Throughout this project, I was involved in a range of tasks that contributed to the project's forward momentum. I attended team meetings, which involved productive collaboration and helped ensure we were on the same page each week. I took the time to familiarize myself with Angular and set up my development environment once the semester got going. I played a role in building out a test plan that included unit tests for our final product. Furthermore, I conducted research on existing platforms similar to our concept, identifying what would set us apart from our competitors in order to effectively market our idea. Additionally, I helped build out the front-end structure of our website, spending a good deal of time troubleshooting issues related to linking it to the API. I was also largely responsible for creating our Spring presentation, and helped build out the HTML for a reworked demo that was presented at the CEAS expo. Finally, I reorganized our project repository at the end of the term to meet the final report requirements. Overall, I worked on a diverse range of tasks that kept me busy throughout the semester and contributed to the end result of our project.

**Total Hours: 51**

### Justification:
I contributed the most in the actual implementation of the web application. Although I did contribute to the initial assignments such as the test plan and user docs, the majority of my contributions are related to the code itself. After the initial backend was set up, I spent many hours working and reworking the front-end with many challenges. I also set up the user authentication system, which was a hurdle since I did not have much experience with that.

**Total Hours: 50**

### Justification:
I ended up doing quite a bit of things all over the spectrum of the project. On some of the smaller assignments throughout the beginning of the semester, such as the test plan and user manual, I contributed a lot. Additionally, I designed our entire expo poster, including everything that was written on it. On the programming side, I created the base project we worked with as well as the Firebase database we went with at first. This took a lot of research because I had worked with web apps before, but they always had a database already integrated in them. Then, I also did a bare bones login/register page in HTML just for a mock-up to have.
