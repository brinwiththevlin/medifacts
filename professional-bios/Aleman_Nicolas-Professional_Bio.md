# Project Sought
I came into my major with an open mind, knowing I wanted to get into the field of Computer Science, but not knowing what direction I wanted to go with it, and I've strived to make my college experience one that allows me to dip my toes in different areas of that. That said, while I would love the opportunity to delve further into the skills I've already developed, such as app development and user interface design and functionality, I would also be more than up for the challenge of picking up new skills in order to work on a project in an area I'm not currently familiar or experienced with. As for the subject matter, I'm honestly an open book and much more keen on the idea of putting in the work to help someone else's vision become a reality.
